# succade

succade helps you to feed your [Lemonbar](https://github.com/LemonBoy/bar). It works almost exactly like [Captain](https://github.com/muse/Captain): succade reads script from `~/.config/succade/blocks` and pipes their output to lemonbar.

# Status

This is currently a work in progress and I'm sure there are nasty bugs still to be found - this is my first time writing C. However, succade seems to work quite well for me already. You might want to give it a try!

# What's missing?

- Clickable areas
- Some formatting features like underline
- Support for multiple bars and monitors

# Dependencies

`inih`, but that's included in this repository, so no need to get it separately.
